# giiview - a light thumb/image viewer for GTK+

The goal of this project is to have a light and comfortable
image viewer for light desktop environments. This is interesting
mostly for people who don't like a simple piece of software to pull in
a whole mass of packages just to have something to display images
quickly.

## This project is under development (*does not work at the moment!*)

The code does not have all the pieces required to make it function. Please be
patient!
